            <h3>Google Unleashes Gemini 2.5 Computer Use: AI Agents Take Control</h3>

            <div class="byline">

                By Google DeepMind



            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p><strong>The leap to autonomous interaction</strong></p>
<p>Google DeepMind has released the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model via API, marking a significant advancement in AI agents' ability to directly interact with computers and mobile devices. This isn't just another chatbot—it's an AI that can see your screen, understand interfaces, and take actions on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this different</strong></p>
<p>The model outperforms leading alternatives at browser and mobile tasks, representing Google's entry into the rapidly evolving "computer use" space pioneered earlier this year by Anthropic's Claude. Unlike traditional AI that generates text or code, computer use models can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate web browsers autonomously</li>
<li>Interact with mobile app interfaces  </li>
<li>Execute multi-step workflows across different applications</li>
<li>Understand visual context from screenshots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The technical architecture</strong></p>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use leverages Google's multimodal AI capabilities, combining vision, language understanding, and action planning. The model processes screen images, interprets UI elements, and generates precise interaction commands—clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating menus—just as a human would.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters for agents</strong></p>
<p>This release accelerates the shift from "AI assistants" to genuine "AI agents." Previous generations required explicit APIs and structured data. Computer use models can work with any interface designed for humans, dramatically expanding their applicability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No API required</strong>: Agents can interact with legacy systems and tools never designed for automation</li>
<li><strong>Faster deployment</strong>: Businesses can automate workflows without custom integrations  </li>
<li><strong>Human-like flexibility</strong>: Agents adapt to UI changes the way people do</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The competitive landscape</strong></p>
<p>Anthropic's Claude Computer Use launched in October 2024, and OpenAI is developing similar capabilities. Google's entry intensifies the race to build practical autonomous agents. Each provider is betting on different architectural approaches—Google emphasizes multimodal understanding, Anthropic focuses on safety and interpretability, while OpenAI pursues agent reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Practical applications emerging</strong></p>
<p>Early adopters are exploring use cases like:
- Automated software testing across web and mobile
- Data entry and migration between incompatible systems
- Customer support agents that can resolve issues by navigating internal tools
- Personal productivity assistants managing tasks across multiple apps</p>
<p><strong>The safety question</strong></p>
<p>Giving AI control of computers raises obvious concerns. Google has implemented guardrails including:
- Observation-only modes for sensitive contexts
- Human approval requirements for certain actions
- Activity logging and audit trails
- Sandboxed execution environments</p>
<p>Still, the model's release via API means developers will determine actual safety implementations in production.</p>
<p><strong>What's next</strong></p>
<p>Computer use capabilities will likely become standard across all major AI platforms by late 2025. The next frontier is coordinating multiple specialized agents—one controlling your calendar, another your email, a third your project management tools—all working in concert as a distributed intelligent workforce.</p>
<p>The question is no longer whether AI can interact with computers autonomously. It's how quickly we can deploy these capabilities responsibly while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions.</p>

            <h3>Legal Infrastructure for the Agent Economy: The Agentic MSA</h3>

            <div class="byline">

                By Arnon Shimoni



            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p><strong>Why standard SaaS contracts don't work for AI agents</strong></p>
<p>Paid.ai and GitLaw have released an open-source Master Services Agreement specifically designed for companies building AI agents. This might sound like boring legal paperwork, but it addresses a critical gap that's been quietly breaking deals and creating liability risks across the agent economy.</p>
<p>The problem is simple: most AI agent companies are using SaaS contracts written for passive software. But agents aren't passive—they make autonomous decisions, take actions without approval, and adapt behavior over time. Traditional contracts don't account for this.</p>
<p><strong>Three ways agents break traditional contracts</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Autonomous decision-making without human approval</strong></p>
<p>Your workflow agent doesn't suggest next steps—it executes them. It sends emails, updates records, moves data between systems. No human clicks "approve" at every stage. Standard SaaS contracts assume software waits for user input. Agents don't.</p>
<p>When something goes wrong, liability becomes murky. Did the customer approve the action? Did the agent malfunction? Is the provider responsible? Traditional contracts leave these questions unanswered, creating legal exposure neither party can properly price.</p>
<p><strong>2. Continuous 24/7 operation</strong></p>
<p>Traditional software processes tasks one at a time when asked. Agents run continuously, making hundreds of micro-decisions. Remember the Ford dealership chatbot that hallucinated a free truck offer? That happened because autonomous systems operating under contracts written for passive tools lack clear liability frameworks for unexpected outputs.</p>
<p><strong>3. Adaptive behavior over time</strong></p>
<p>Static software behaves the same way every deployment. Agents learn from context, adjust to patterns, change behavior based on accumulated data. The system you shipped six months ago operates differently today. Your SaaS contract wasn't built for this evolutionary characteristic.</p>
<p><strong>What the Agentic MSA actually covers</strong></p>
<p>Working with GitLaw's team, Paid.ai identified three critical areas that traditional contracts fail to address:</p>
<p><strong>Agent classification and decision responsibility</strong></p>
<p>The MSA establishes that agents function as sophisticated tools, not autonomous employees. When a customer's agent books 500 meetings with the wrong prospect list, the answer to "who approved that?" must be clear: the customer deployed the agent with specific parameters and maintained oversight responsibility.</p>
<p>The contract includes explicit language in Section 1.2 protecting providers from liability for autonomous decisions while clarifying customer responsibility for deployment and monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Liability limitations and risk allocation</strong></p>
<p>AI agents hallucinate—they produce confident outputs that are wrong. The MSA includes explicit disclaimers that agent outputs require human verification before material business decisions. It also includes damage caps appropriate for unpredictable systems: typically 12 months of fees with exclusions for indirect losses.</p>
<p>This isn't being difficult; it's acknowledging you can't predict every edge case in software that learns and adapts. Section 7 covers liability limitations with AI-specific disclaimers in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><strong>Data ownership and training rights</strong></p>
<p>This kills more deals than any other contract issue. Agents ingest customer data and generate outputs. Providers might want to use interactions to improve models. Customers panic when they hear this—they imagine proprietary data training models that help competitors.</p>
<p>The MSA establishes that customers own their data and agent outputs. Then it provides separate, customizable language about using de-identified, aggregated data for training purposes, with clear opt-out options.</p>
<p>Most customers accept training use when it's explained transparently. Trying to slip it in through vague language destroys trust. Section 2.1 covers ownership with customizable training permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters for agent monetization</strong></p>
<p>At Paid, we solve billing and cost tracking for AI agents, but we kept hearing the same problem before companies even got to pricing: they couldn't figure out how to charge for agents because they were trying to price outcome-based work using terms written for seat-based software.</p>
<p>You can't bill for outcomes if your contract only covers usage. You can't price based on value delivered if your liability framework assumes predictable, passive behavior. You can't protect your margins when the legal foundation doesn't match what your product does.</p>
<p>The contract shapes everything that comes after. Get it wrong and your entire business model sits on shaky ground.</p>
<p><strong>Built on open standards</strong></p>
<p>The Agentic MSA uses CommonPaper's Software Licensing Agreement and AI Addendum as foundation, adapted for AI agents' unique characteristics. It's available now as open source in the GitLaw Community, where you can access it directly or ask the GitLaw AI Agent to generate a customized version.</p>
<p>Because the law around AI agents is evolving rapidly, treat this as a starting point, not a substitute for legal advice. Work with a commercial lawyer to customize it for your specific situation.</p>
<p><strong>The bigger picture</strong></p>
<p>Legal frameworks always lag behind technology. Right now that lag creates real risk for anyone building agents. You can ignore it and hope nothing breaks, or you can use contracts built for what agents actually do, not what software did ten years ago.</p>
<p>Most founders choose hope. The ones who survive choose better infrastructure—and that starts with legal foundations that match your product's capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Vibe Engineering: The New Discipline of AI-Assisted Development</h3>

            <div class="byline">

                By Simon Willison



            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p><strong>Beyond vibe coding</strong></p>
<p>Simon Willison, a respected voice in AI development, has proposed a provocative new term: "vibe engineering." It's a deliberate reclamation of "vibes"—previously used dismissively for sloppy, prompt-driven coding—to describe the sophisticated practice of leveraging AI tools while maintaining full accountability for production software.</p>
<p><strong>The distinction matters</strong></p>
<p>"Vibe coding" has become shorthand for the fast, loose, and irresponsible way of building with AI—entirely prompt-driven, with no attention to how code actually works. But there's a terminology gap: what do we call the opposite end of the spectrum, where experienced engineers accelerate their work with LLMs while staying proudly accountable for what they produce?</p>
<p><strong>Why "vibe engineering" works</strong></p>
<p>Willison chose the term deliberately:
- <strong>It's cheeky and controversial</strong>, which helps it spread
- <strong>It's self-contradictory</strong> (vibes vs. engineering), making it memorable
- <strong>It reclaims "vibes"</strong> for something constructive rather than dismissive
- <strong>It signals distinction</strong> from vibe coding through clear gatekeeping</p>
<p><strong>The hard truth about working productively with LLMs</strong></p>
<p>One lesser-spoken truth: using LLMs productively as a software engineer on non-toy projects is <em>difficult</em>. There's depth to understanding these tools, plenty of traps to avoid, and the pace at which they churn out code raises the bar for what humans should contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Coding agents change everything</strong></p>
<p>The rise of coding agents—tools like Claude Code, OpenAI's Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI that iterate on code, actively testing and modifying until achieving specified goals—has dramatically increased LLMs' usefulness for real-world problems.</p>
<p>Willison reports hearing from experienced engineers running multiple agents in parallel, tackling several problems simultaneously and expanding their scope. He was skeptical at first but started doing it himself: "It's surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting!"</p>
<p><strong>AI rewards top-tier engineering practices</strong></p>
<p>LLMs actively reward existing best practices:</p>
<p><strong>Automated testing</strong>: With robust, comprehensive test suites, agents can fly. Without tests, agents might claim something works without testing, and changes could break features without you realizing it.</p>
<p><strong>Planning in advance</strong>: Iterating on high-level plans before handing off to agents dramatically improves outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong>: LLMs can only keep a codebase subset in context. Good documentation lets them use APIs without reading all the code first.</p>
<p><strong>Good version control</strong>: Undoing mistakes and understanding changes is crucial when agents make modifications. LLMs are also "fiercely competent at Git"—they can navigate history, track down bug origins, and excel at <code>git bisect</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Effective automation</strong>: CI/CD, formatting, linting, preview environments—agents benefit from the same automation infrastructure humans do.</p>
<p><strong>Code review culture</strong>: If you're fast and productive at code review, you'll have a much better time with LLMs than if you'd rather write code yourself.</p>
<p><strong>A weird form of management</strong>: Getting good results from coding agents feels uncomfortably close to managing human collaborators. You need clear instructions, necessary context, and actionable feedback. It's easier than working with people (you can't offend them), but management experience proves surprisingly useful.</p>
<p><strong>Strong QA skills</strong>: Beyond automated tests, you need to excel at manual testing, including predicting and digging into edge cases.</p>
<p><strong>Research skills</strong>: There are dozens of ways to solve any problem. Figuring out the best options and proving an approach remains a blocker before unleashing an agent.</p>
<p><strong>Preview environments</strong>: Having ways to safely preview agent-built features without deploying to production makes reviews more productive and reduces shipping broken code.</p>
<p><strong>Updated estimation</strong>: Estimating project timelines has always been hard. AI-assisted coding makes it harder—things that took long are faster, but estimations now depend on new factors we're still figuring out.</p>
<p><strong>AI amplifies existing expertise</strong></p>
<p>The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer, the faster and better the results you get from working with LLMs and coding agents. Vibe engineering establishes a clear distinction from vibe coding—it signals this is a different, harder, and more sophisticated way of building production software.</p>
<p><strong>Why the mismatch works</strong></p>
<p>Willison likes "the clear mismatch between 'vibes' and 'engineering.' It makes the combined term self-contradictory in a way that I find mischievous and (hopefully) sticky."</p>
<p>He's tried getting terms like "AI-assisted programming" to stick with approximately zero success. "May as well try rubbing some vibes on it and see what happens."</p>
<p><strong>Operating at the top of your game</strong></p>
<p>If you're going to exploit these new tools' capabilities, you need to operate at the top of your game. You're responsible for:
- Writing specifications
- Defining success criteria
- Designing agentic loops
- Planning QA
- Managing a growing army of "weird digital interns who will absolutely cheat if you give them a chance"
- Spending so much time on code review</p>
<p>Almost all of these are characteristics of senior software engineers already. Vibe engineering is gatekeeping, yes—but it's the productive kind that acknowledges building production software with AI requires genuine expertise and sophistication, not just clever prompts.</p>

            <h3>Qualcomm Acquires Arduino: IoT Meets AI Agents</h3>

            <div class="byline">

                By Qualcomm



            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>In a surprise move signaling the convergence of IoT and AI agents, Qualcomm announced its acquisition of Arduino, the popular open-source hardware platform. The deal (terms undisclosed) positions Qualcomm to embed AI agent capabilities directly into edge devices and embedded systems.</p>
<p>Arduino's developer community of millions has long built IoT projects using its accessible microcontroller boards. Qualcomm's AI and connectivity expertise combined with Arduino's reach could enable a new generation of intelligent, autonomous edge devices—from smart sensors that make local decisions to robotic systems coordinating without cloud connectivity.</p>
<p>The acquisition suggests a strategic bet on "edge agents"—AI systems that operate autonomously on resource-constrained devices rather than relying on centralized cloud infrastructure. This matters for industrial automation, robotics, and smart city applications where latency, reliability, and data privacy are critical.</p>
<p><strong>What's next</strong>: Expect Qualcomm to release AI-optimized Arduino boards and development tools that make it easier for makers and enterprises to deploy agentic systems at the edge. This could dramatically expand where and how autonomous agents operate.</p>

            <h3>The Agentic AI Market Explodes: $28B to $127B by 2029</h3>

            <div class="byline">

                By Flobotics Research



            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>New market research reveals agentic AI is experiencing explosive growth, expanding from $28 billion in 2024 to a projected $127 billion by 2029—a compound annual growth rate exceeding 35%.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that by 2029, agentic AI will autonomously resolve 80% of common customer service issues, cutting operational costs by 30%. The shift from "AI assistants" to genuine autonomous agents is driving adoption across industries:</p>
<p><strong>Key trends</strong>:

                <p><strong>The pattern across today's stories</strong></p>
<p>Three seemingly unrelated announcements—a new AI model, a legal contract template, and a term for engineering practices—actually reveal a unified trend: the AI agent economy is maturing from experimentation to infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>From capabilities to deployment</strong></p>
<p>Google's Gemini 2.5 Computer Use represents the "what"—agents that can interact with any computer interface. LlamaFarm provides the "where"—distributed infrastructure for deploying agents at scale. The Agentic MSA addresses the "how"—legal frameworks that match what agents actually do.</p>
<p>But Simon Willison's "vibe engineering" might be the most important piece: the "who." Building production-ready agents requires senior engineering expertise, not just clever prompts. As Willison notes, LLMs "amplify existing expertise"—the more skills you bring, the better your results.</p>
<p><strong>The infrastructure stack is forming</strong></p>
<p>Every technology wave requires infrastructure before mainstream adoption:
- <strong>Legal layer</strong>: Contracts that define liability and responsibility (Agentic MSA)
- <strong>Deployment layer</strong>: Systems to run agents reliably (LlamaFarm, Computer Use APIs)<br />
- <strong>Practice layer</strong>: Disciplined engineering approaches (Vibe Engineering)
- <strong>Economic layer</strong>: Market reaching sufficient scale ($127B by 2029)</p>
<p>We're watching all four layers crystallize simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>The shift from "AI" to "agents"</strong></p>
<p>Notice the language change: companies aren't building "AI features" anymore—they're deploying "agents." This isn't just marketing. Agents represent a fundamental shift from software that responds to commands to systems that pursue goals autonomously.</p>
<p>This shift requires different infrastructure:
- Standard software needs APIs; agents need computer use capabilities
- SaaS contracts cover passive tools; agent contracts handle autonomous decision-making
- Traditional coding uses AI as assistant; vibe engineering makes AI a collaborative partner
- Centralized cloud serves request/response; distributed systems enable autonomous operation</p>
<p><strong>What to watch</strong></p>
<p>The next six months will reveal whether this infrastructure stack is sufficient, or whether we'll discover new gaps. My predictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Orchestration frameworks</strong> will emerge to coordinate multiple specialized agents</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and observability tools</strong> specific to agent behavior will become critical  </li>
<li><strong>Insurance products</strong> covering agent actions will launch (and fail, then succeed)</li>
<li><strong>Certification programs</strong> for "vibe engineers" will proliferate (some legitimate, most not)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The bigger question</strong></p>
<p>Today's stories reflect optimism about agents' potential. But autonomous systems making decisions at scale raise questions we're only beginning to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who's liable when an agent causes harm?</li>
<li>How do we maintain human oversight without bottlenecking agent advantages?</li>
<li>What happens when agents interact with other agents in unexpected ways?</li>
<li>Can we trust systems that adapt and learn over time?</li>
</ul>
<p>The infrastructure emerging today will shape how we answer these questions. Get it right and we unlock tremendous productivity. Get it wrong and we create risks we're not prepared to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters to you</strong></p>
<p>If you're building with AI agents: this infrastructure is your foundation. Don't skip the legal frameworks, engineering discipline, or deployment infrastructure. The companies succeeding with agents aren't the ones with the cleverest prompts—they're the ones building on solid infrastructure from day one.</p>
<p>If you're watching this space: we're past the proof-of-concept phase. The agent economy is real, growing fast, and beginning to mature. The next wave isn't about whether agents work—it's about deploying them responsibly at scale.</p>
<p>That's the story behind today's headlines. Not just what's possible with agents, but what it takes to make them real.</p>
